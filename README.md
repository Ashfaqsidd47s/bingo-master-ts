#Bingo Master 
An online multiplayer board game that can be played between two players 
its a thoughtfuly intesting twisted version of the classic bingo game 
OR WE CAN SAY A BLEND OF BINGO AND CHESS THE GMAE IS SIMPLE AND STRAIGHT FORWARD 
YOU HAVE S 5 * 5 BOARD IN WHICH NUMBERS (1- 25 ) ARE ARANGED RANDOMLY AND IN YOUR TURN YOU CAN CALL ANY ANY NUMBER 
OF YOUR CHOICE SO AS THE OPONENT 
AND THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO CANCEL OUT 5 ROWS OR COLUMNS OR DIAGONAL (ANY COMBINATION )AND IF YOU ARE ABLE TO SCORE FIRST BINGO YOU WON THE GAME 

THIS WAS THE GAME THAT I USED TO PLAY IN MY SCHOOL TIME 
AND FOR ME THIS WAS THE CLASSIC BING AND WHEN I SEARCHED THE BINGO GAME IN INTERENET I WAS LIKE MAN THIS BINGO IS SO WEARD OURS WAS GREAT SO WHY NOT JUST CREATE THIS 

AND I LOVED WEBSOCKET AS I WANTED TO CREATE PROJECTS USING WEBSOCKET SO IT WAS A NICE PROJECT FOR ME BECAUSE TERE ARE TOUN OF TUTORIALS FOR CHESS GAME AND CHESS ALSO NEDS A KIND OF TECHINICAL KNOWLEDGE OF GAME NOT ANYONE CAN START PLAYING IT THEN TICK TACK TO ITS TOO EASY LIKE KIDS THING SO THIS GAME IS REALLY A MIDDLE GROWND 

SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE BORED BY MY LONG DEV LOG 
YOU CAN START PLAYING IT RIGHT AT THIS LINK 

SO I HAVE CREATED ITS PREVIOUS VERSION WHICH WAS WORKING BUT THE UI WAS REALLY BAD AND WHEN I SHOWED THE GAMES TO MY FRIEND THEY WERE LIKE BRO ITS LOOKING LIKE ALREDY BROKEN 
I WAS LIKE MAN I KNOW UI IS BAD BECAUSE I DONT HAVE ANY REFERENCING GAME ECJACTLY LIKE THIS TO REPLICATE A UI 
AND I AM NOT A DESINER 

BUT IF YOU HAVE TO SHOW YOUR FRIENDS YOU ARE A GREAT DEVELOPER YOU JUST NEED TO CREAT SOME FANCY TRENDY UI JUST WHICH LOOKS GREAT BECAUSE NO ONE WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU DID IMPLEMENTED IT FROM SCRATCH ( UNLESS YOU ARE A REAL DEV YOURSELF )

SO FOR ME EVERYTHING WAS ALMOST DONE AND WORKING JSUT UI WAS THE BIGGEST HUDDEL FOR ME 
so after watching countless dribble examples and mobile game designes i end up with this 
which might not work for others but i found it pleasing atleast looking great 

which is hear the old vs new comparision 


well now lets jump into the technicalities a talk between devs 
which i am thinking i should make a navbar in this readme file so that people can navigate to which part they want to see ( shit now my brain is like you should create a documentation but lets drop it for now )


so for this project i used the most populular MERN ( O sorry it will be PERN stack postgress express then react then nodejs ) and all is done with type scricpt keeping silly joks asid 

in backend i used express as websockets and ( websockets with ws not socket.io that provides room functionality it self ) so i implemented room functionality myself which is kind of simple and make more sence to me as i was

WHAT I  HAVE BUILD IS AN ONLINE VERSION  OF THE
